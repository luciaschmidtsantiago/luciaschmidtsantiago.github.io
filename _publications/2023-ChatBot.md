BioImage.IO Chatbot: A Personalized Assistant for BioImage Analysis Augmented by Community Knowledge Base

The rapidly expanding landscape of bioimage analysis tools presents a navigational challenge for both experts and newcomers. Traditional search methods often fall short in assisting users in this complex environment. To address this, we introduce the BioImage.IO Chatbot, an AI-driven conversational assistant tailored for the bioimage community. Built upon large language models, this chatbot provides personalized, context-aware answers by aggregating and interpreting information from diverse databases, tool-specific documentation, and structured data sources. Enhanced by a community-contributed knowledge base and fine-tuned retrieval methods, the BioImage.IO Chatbot offers not just a personalized interaction but also a knowledge-enriched, context-aware experience. It fundamentally transforms the way biologists, bioimage analysts, and developers navigate and utilize advanced bioimage analysis tools, setting a new standard for community-driven, accessible scientific research..
