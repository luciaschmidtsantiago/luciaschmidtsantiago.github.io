## Can You Afford to Research? The Financial Strain of Ph.D. Students in Spain

### Abstract:
This study examines the financial challenges affecting the decline in Ph. D. candidates and completions in Spain, focusing on Ph. D. scholarships and rising living costs. Using government data, we analyse FPU and PIF scholarships compared to national salaries, inflation, and housing affordability in recent years. We find that scholarships are significantly below national salary averages, with housing costs often unaffordable. Financial strain, worsened by limited scholarship increases, contributes to low doctoral completion rates and reduced interest in academic careers. We conclude that current funding is insufficient, pushing Ph. D. candidates towards better-paying jobs outside academia. Policy reforms are needed to provide adequate support and sustain the academic workforce.
