## Who I am
Hello, I'm LucÃ­a!

I am a PhD student and pre-doctoral researcher at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (UC3M) in the [ML4DS](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/GruposInvestigacion/es/Detalle/Organismo_C/1371210502854/1371325143833/?d=Touch) group. I work closely with my supervisor, Dra. Vanessa GÃ³mez Verdejo, exploring the exciting field of biomedical science, engineering, and machine learning.

My PhD explores the potential of generative AI to advance microbiology and clinical diagnostics. I apply deep learning (DL) models to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data, an essential tool for bacterial characterization. My research revolves around key questions:
- Can we fully characterize bacteria using only spectrometry data?
- How far can we push predictive modeling for bacterial identification and antimicrobial resistance?
- Is it possible to generate realistic synthetic data to enhance microbiology datasets?

Every day, I work to uncover new insights, develop novel models, and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in computational microbiology.

Beyond my work with microbiology data, I have a strong passion for signal and image analysis. I have contributed to projects involving DECT images for improving proton therapy dose calculation algorithms, as well as histopathology research, where I developed semantic segmentation models to analyze tumor microenvironments in breast cancer images.

Through this website, I aim to share my research, insights, and experiences with the scientific community. If youâ€™re interested in collaborations, discussions, or just exploring ideas, feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
