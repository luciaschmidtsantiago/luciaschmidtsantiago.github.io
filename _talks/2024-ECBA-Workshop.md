I had the pleasure to attend and present at the Workshop for [Effectively Communicating Bioimage Analysis](https://www.biologists.com/workshops/february-2024/) in East Sussex, UK organised by [The Company of Biologists](https://www.biologists.com) and [Focal Plane](https://focalplane.biologists.com). 
In this workshop not only I had the most precious time at the Buxted Park but also I had the opportunity to present the [deepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io) project and learn from the best in the field.
