During the [AI4Life Workshop of Zero-Code Tools and BioImage Model Zoo Community Partners](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/event/workshop-hackathon-uploathon-madrid/) I had the pleasure to give a presentation about the BioImage.IO Chatbot together with Wanlu Lei, Benedict Diederich, Songtao Cheng, and Wei Ouyang.
