Since January 2024, [Elixir](https://elixir-europe.org) has been hosting virtual talks on generative AI. I was fortunate to secure a presentation slot to showcase the [BioImage.IO Chatbot](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimageio-chatbot) and its latest features. This includes the integration of [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) from Elixir into our chatbot's knowledge base.

For the talk, I prepared a brief demonstration on how to precisely extract information from key resources such as [bio.tools](https://bio.tools) and the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io). I also demonstrated running the CellPose model on an image directly through the chatbot. For a detailed guide on how to replicate this, visit our [documentation](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimageio-chatbot/blob/main/docs/figure-2-use-cases.md#scenario-d-running-ai-models-for-image-analysis).

The presentation is available [here](https://github.com/bioimage-io/bioimageio-chatbot/blob/main/docs/Elixir-Presentation.pdf).

I am very grateful for this opportunity!
