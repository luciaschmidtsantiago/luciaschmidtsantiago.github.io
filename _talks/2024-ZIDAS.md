On June 2024 I had the pleasure to present the [BioImage.IO Chatbot](https://bioimage.io/chat/) at the [ZIDAS Summer School](https://2024.zidas.org) in ETH Zurich, Switzerland. The ZIDAS Summer School is a unique event that brings together leading experts in the field of bioimage analysis, providing a platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration.

I also had the opportunity to participate as a trainer during the hands-on sessions, guiding participants through the process of using Python on thursday and the BioImage.IO Chatbot on friday. It was a fantastic experience to engage with the next generation of researchers and share insights on the latest advancements in bioimage analysis.
