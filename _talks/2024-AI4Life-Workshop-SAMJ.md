During the [AI4Life Workshop of Zero-Code Tools and BioImage Model Zoo Community Partners](https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/event/workshop-hackathon-uploathon-madrid/) I had the pleasure to give a presentation about Transformers, Vision Transformers and our new development for a Fiji Plugin:SAMJ. Great thanks to Daniel Sage and Carlos J. García López de Haro whom I had the pleasure to present with.
