I had the pleasure to present our precious [BioImage.IO Chatbot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18351) at the [Virtual Pub of Euro-Bioimaging](https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/about-us/virtual-pub) as part of the AI4Life Project. 

The chatbot is a revolutionary tool that will transform bioimage analysis as we know it. It is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for researchers to access and use bioimage models. The chatbot is built on top of the [BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io) ecosystem, which is a community-driven platform for sharing bioimage analysis models.
